The 'char' instruction is emitted by the compiler when a string literal
matcher is specified in grammar. The string is then split up into its
individual bytes, and each byte is emitted as a 'char' instruction
(although in gpeg, an optimization exists whereby four bytes can be
matched at the same time: the 'quad' instruction).
