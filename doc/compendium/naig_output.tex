\section{Output}

When the gpeg engine exits, it may do so in the following states:

\begin{itemize}
\item Engine failure. The engine got corrupted somehow. This is not
      recoverable. You should restart any relevant software in this case.
\item Bytecode failure. The bytecode caused an endless loop, tried
      to jump to an out-of-bounds offset, or contained an unknown
      instruction opcode.
\item Parsing failure. The stack was unwound without seeing the 'end'
      instruction first. Your input does not match your grammar.
\item Parsing success. The engine encountered an 'end' instruction.
      Your input matches your grammar.
\item Parsing success including captures.
      The endine encountered an 'end' instruction and there where
      captures.
\end{itemize}
