\subsection{Parsing Expression Grammars}

This is the documentation describing gpeg, which is a collection of
specifications, libraries and tools enabling data parsing. It is based, by
now loosely, on Lua Parsing Expression Grammars, or LPEG [REF].

\subsection{gpeg}

gpeg adds to Lua PEG the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\item Discoverability features:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item An assembler step in between grammar and bytecode.
  \item An engine debugger.
  \item A bytecode disassembler.
  \end{itemize}

\item Security features:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bit upset event detection and traps.
  \item Endless loop detection.
  \end{itemize}

\item Interoperability with C (library, header files).
\item As well as Java, Perl and Rust.
\item Added instructions for matchers (ranges, quads).
\item Added instructions for counters (to enable efficient looping).
\item Added instructions for parsing binary inputs.
\end{itemize}
