\section{Generations}

gpeg is written in generations. That is to say:
each subsequent generation of gpeg uses the tools generated
in the previous one, to build itself ('the grammar parses the grammar').

The following generations exist, with the following functions:

\begin{itemize}

\item Generation zero: This generation consists solely of a bootstrap
      grammar compiler and assembler written in perl. Plus a C engine
      to be used by the subsequent generation.

\item Generation one: This generation is
      built in C, based on the bytecode to parse grammar grammar
      and assembly grammar, generated by generation zero.

\item Generation two: equal to generation one, but then based on
      the bytecode generated by the tooling in generation one.
      Generation two is 'pure' in that it has compiled itself,
      and it only provides parsing.

\end{itemize}
